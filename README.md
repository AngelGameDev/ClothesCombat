# ClothesCombat
Clothes Combat, a billboarded retro shooter where 6 players (split screen!) fire t-shirt cannons at each other in a mall, forcing their targets to wear their shirt color. The more people are wearing your shirt color, the more points you generate over time, until you win.

Made for a UCF vs USF jam forever ago. I have no idea if this is the latest project state.
