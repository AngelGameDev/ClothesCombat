# ClothesCombat
Clothes Combat, a billboarded retro shooter where 6 players (split screen!) fire t-shirt canons at each other in a mall, making their wear their shirt color. players win by having more total seconds of others wearing their shirt colors.

Made for a UCF vs USF jam forever ago. I have no idea if this is the latest project state.
